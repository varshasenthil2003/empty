# Urban Insights Explorer üåÜ

Urban Insights Explorer is a data exploration and analysis tool developed during the hackathon. It leverages data from the U.S. Census Bureau to provide insights into demographics at the city and zip code levels, focusing on California and Washington states. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization components.

## Problem Statement üéØ

The goal of this project is to create a visual dashboard that allows users to explore and compare demographic attributes across different cities and zip codes. The dashboard provides insights into population characteristics, occupations, median income, and more, using data from the '2017-2021 ACS 5-year Estimates' dataset.
